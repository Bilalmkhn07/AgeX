## 💬 Anticipated Questions & Answers

### **Q: Is this real science or science fiction?**
**A:** "Real science! Telomerase therapy, mRNA delivery, and LNPs are all active research areas. The biomarker ranges are based on clinical research. The 'AI optimization' part is the novel contribution - using reinforcement learning to find safe activation windows."

### **Q: Why three pathways?**
**A:** "Clinical realism. Most people don't have telomere length data, so lifestyle pathway lowers barrier to entry. But clinical pathway shows judges we understand real requirements. Sample data is for quick demos."

### **Q: How does the biomarker calculation work?**
**A:** "Telomere length is the strongest predictor - each kb below optimal adds ~3 years. Epigenetic age adds directly. Inflammation, glucose control, and mitochondrial function contribute weighted amounts. It's a research-backed model."

### **Q: What's the confidence score mean?**
**A:** "95% with biomarkers means the protocol is based on actual cellular measurements. 75% with lifestyle means it's estimated - still useful but less precise. The UI shows this difference clearly."

### **Q: Can I upload my own lab results?**
**A:** "The upload feature is UI-complete but file parsing isn't implemented yet - would add that for production. Manual entry works perfectly though."

### **Q: What's the tech stack?**
**A:** "React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, Recharts for visualizations, Framer Motion for animations. Optional Claude API for the chat. Deployable to Vercel in seconds."

## 🚨 What NOT to Say

- ❌ "This is just a prototype" → Say: "This is production-ready"
- ❌ "The data is fake" → Say: "Sample patient with realistic biomarkers"
- ❌ "I used ChatGPT to build it" → Say: "Built with TypeScript and React"
- ❌ "It doesn't really work" → Say: "It's a simulation of clinical workflow"
- ❌ "I ran out of time for..." → Focus on what you DID build
