## What Makes This Special

Most hackathon health apps use fake data or simplistic inputs. This app:

1. **Uses real clinical biomarkers** that doctors actually measure
2. **Shows the math** - biological age calculations are transparent
3. **Demonstrates AI value** - optimization, safety, personalization
4. **Educates users** - explains telomerase, mRNA, LNPs clearly
5. **Looks production-ready** - not a prototype, a product

**Result:** Judges see a credible longevity medicine platform, not a toy demo.
